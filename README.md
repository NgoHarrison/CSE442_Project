Debate Web Application

In this project, we are going to implement a debate application that runs on the web. The idea is coming from Professor Hartloff. In this application there will be essentially these features: Social media for debates, Users can submit statements for debate and everyone chooses to agree or disagree and discusses, The top arguments both for and against the statement are shown, Users are encouraged to consider both sides of debateS. 

To build this web application these are the technologies we are planning to use: at the front-end HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and at the back-end Spark with Java by building a rest api.
